    "This program implements the classic \"Guess the Number\" game. The user is prompted to guess a randomly selected number within a defined range. The code provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it's too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the correct number is guessed. This exercise demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, including random number generation, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling."
