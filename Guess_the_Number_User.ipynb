    "In \"Guess the Number (User Edition)\", the roles are reversed compared to the classic game. Here, the computer tries to guess a number chosen by the user. The user sets the range and picks a number within it. The computer makes guesses, while the user gives feedback if each guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game showcases algorithms for efficient guessing, like binary search, and continues until the computer guesses correctly. It's a simple yet engaging demonstration of user-computer interaction, decision-making algorithms, and basic programming concepts in Python."
